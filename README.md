#### GitHub Action to remove old artifacts

Status and support

- &#x2714; stable
- &#x2714; supported
- &#x2716; no ongoing development

[![CI](/../../workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](/../../actions)

GitHub Action Artifacts are removed after [90 days](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Managing-Actions-storage-space/m-p/41424/highlight/true#M4618). This cannot be configured either globally or per project. There's also a limit on free artifact space after which it becomes a payed resource. There's no configurable storage limit per project either, so some projects might use up all quota and not leave room for others.

We created this Action to solve these problems. It
- removes artifacts that are older than the specified age
- has the option to keep release (tagged) artifacts
- has the option to keep a number of recent artifacts
- [respects](https://github.com/octokit/plugin-throttling.js) GitHub's rate limit
